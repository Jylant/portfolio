# Portfolio Website

This project was created as a portfolio to showcase my work. It was built using a variety of technologies and tools, which I'll outline below.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- SCSS: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
- GitHub API: Used to fetch READMEs from my repositories.

## Setup and Running

Follow these steps to run this project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate into the directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

The website should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Improvements

- Add more projects to the portfolio.
- Improve the design and layout of the website.
