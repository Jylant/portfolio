I had to learn a lot about how to structure the backend for it with JAVA and Spring, and I didn't have time to finish the frontend for it. I'm still happy with the work I did on it, and I'm glad I got to learn more about JAVA and Spring."

I had some trouble with getting the data to show up properly, but the process was very educational. I can say that I learned a lot about debugging and using Qt, including signals and slots."

The leadership role fell onto me, as I was the one who suggested the project idea, and I was the one who designed the state machine for the game logic. I think I did a decent job balancing the workloads according to each member's interests and capabilities. I also created the interrupt based timer for the game logic, based on provided assembly examples. Since our project was ahead of schedule, I quickly designed and implemented a Simon Says game. I directed and helped the other group members throughout the project, and I think we did a great job. We also designed the presentation and poster together. The project had no github repository, as we didn't use any version control.",
        "challenges" : "Stepping into the leadership role did not come naturally to me, but I think I did a good job. I had to learn how to balance the workloads and how to direct the other group members. I learned some good techniques for more efficient vision communication. Implementing the interrupt based timer seemed daunting at first, but I managed to do it with the help of the provided assembly examples. Directing the other group members and alleviating their concerns was less of a challenge than I thought it would be, which I can wholeheartedly attribute to the good group dynamic we had."
